# Reporting

#### Below are links to reporting configurations for the standard Google Analytics UI. These are built to work with the Google Tag Manager configuration available as part of Unified Analytics, designed to pull out the custom data we are passing to GA.

To use, you should make sure you're logged in to the Google Analytics account in which you wish to view data, then click the links below. GA will ask you which views you'd like to have the custom report available. Select and click `Ok` and the reports will be available under the `Customization` in the top menu.
